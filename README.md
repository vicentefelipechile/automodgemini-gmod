## What is this?

Gemini Automod is a tool/application for assisted moderation support for Garry's Mod game servers using Google's artificial intelligence technology "**Gemini**".

The application records all player activity in logs, based on parameters predefined by the user, the artificial intelligence can suggest actions to be performed by the staff on certain players with strange behavior (breaking rules, harassing players, actions harmful to the server, etc.) using the logs.

This process of interacting with players who break the rules is called moderation, and the application is designed to assist the staff in this process. Because the player who breaks the rules or acts in a harmful way can lie or manipulate the staff, the application can help the staff to have a more accurate view of the situation.

> **Advert:** *It is important to note that the application can only suggest actions to be taken by the staff, the final decision is always up to the staff.*
